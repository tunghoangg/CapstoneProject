# Remote Administrator Farm System (RAFS) 


Remote Administrator Farm System (RAFS) came up with 3 main solutions. 
RAFS provides services that allow technicians to manage, track, monitor, and record details of basic operations on the farm such as planting, caring, harvesting, spending, and raw materials. From the data collected, the system summary and analysis in order to help the Farm Owner make future decisions about the farm. Also, RAFS integrates communication through blog channels and the farm detail section. Therefore, the client can observe and evaluate the products of a farm to make decisions to cooperate, buy, sell, and invest.
My responsible in this project is to create blog management feature using CKEditor 5 and Google Drive api to upload and save image , writing document, test case, do all the test.
